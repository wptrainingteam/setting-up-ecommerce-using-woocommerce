## Notes for the Presenter

*   It's recommended that you take students through some of the factors they need to consider when selecting an eCommerce plugin. Then show them how to search for eCommerce plugins in the WordPress Directory [Teacher Resources] (https:https://wordpress.org/plugins/) page. 
*   It's recommended that you model the process for completing each example task first. Then the students should repeat the actions using their own devices. Make yourself available for questions and troubleshooting if something doesn’t work out.
*   It is easiest for students to work on a locally installed copy of WordPress. If possible, send instructions on how to do this to all students before the class. In case need help, set time aside before class to assist with the local installation. For more information on how to install WordPress locally, please visit our [Teacher Resources](https://make.wordpress.org/training/teacher-resources/) page.
*   The preferred answer to the screening questions is “yes.” Participants who reply “no” to question 1 might need a bit of explanation. If they answer “no” to questions 2 & 3, you can group them with other students to work in pairs on the installation.
*   You may print out the Example Lesson part to use it as handouts. To keep it green and preserve the links used throughout the document, send it out as a PDF file.
*   This lesson is an introduction to using WooCommerce. It does not cover its full functionality. At the end of the lesson, please refer your students to the WooCommerce documentation. It will be helpful to show what the documentation looks like and how to use it to help them fine-tune their shops. 
* What if the participant doesn't have the correct version of WordPress and plugin?
* What if the participant's user role doesn't allow plugin and theme installation?
* What if the participant's site is hosted on WordPress.com and doesn't have the access to install plugin and theme?

## Example Lesson

### Overview: Searching for an eCommerce plugin

Think about what your eCommerce retailer needs. For instance, are they selling physical, digital or subscription based products or services? Do they need shipping and inventory management? What is their budget? Knowing what their requirements are will help you determine the right eCommerce plugin for their WordPress store. 

Armed with what they need, you can then search for the plugin that best suits their requirements using the WordPress plugin directory. Some of the popular options are:
*   WooCommerce
*   Easy Digital Downloads
*   MemberPress
*   Shopify
*   EcWid
*   BigCommerce
*   Give

### Introduction: What is WooCommerce for?

WooCommerce is an e-commerce plugin for small to large-sized online merchants using WordPress. Some of its important benefits are:

*   The plugin itself is free.
*   It is very flexible, offering a wide range of product options for selling. 
*   It has over 300 free and paid extensions to choose from.
*   The customer data is independent of any third party software platform.
*   WooCommerce is 100% open source. (This allows you to benefit from an active and growing community of contributors.)

During the flow of the lesson, we will be working for an imaginary company called YayWP! which sells large sized photo prints that you might want to use to decorate your home. You will install the WooCommerce plugin, set up the new e-shop, add products to the store, and review the menu options and reports. You will also learn about resources you can study to continue refining your e-shop to suit your needs.

### Setting up the shop

#### Preparation

First, you need to have WordPress (version 4.7 and above) installed. The second step will be to select a theme for the shop look & feel. Generally, it’s best if the theme is built and optimized for WooCommerce (here is [a guide](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/choosing-the-right-theme/) you can use).

In this lesson, you'll use the [Storefront](https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/) theme. This is from WooThemes, the creators of WooCommerce. It is designed to build e-commerce websites. Install and activate the theme before you proceed.

> ![(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/contributor-resources/master/images/icon-idea.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/contributor-resources/master/images/icon-idea.png)Storefront is the theme WooThemes recommends for use with WooCommerce (it's their theme, after all!). There are plenty of other free and commercial themes optimized WooCommerce. If you don't use a theme designed for WooCommerce, you'll probably have to add code and other modifications to make your store work.

#### WooCommerce Installation

>![(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/contributor-resources/master/images/icon-idea.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/contributor-resources/master/images/icon-idea.png)For training purposes, it’s okay to use a local installation of WordPress. For a real-life scenario, you need to be running WordPress on a self-hosted site. It's important to review server requirements before installation. Otherwise, you may encounter issues when using WooCommerce.

1\. You will now perform an automatic install of WooCommerce plugin. Log into your WordPress Dashboard and go to **Plugins > Add New**. In the search field, type “WooCommerce” and click Search Plugins. 

[![Installing WooCommerce](/images/installingwoocommerce.png)](/images/installingwoocommerce.png)

Install the newly found plugin by clicking **Install Now** and activate a plugin when prompted by clicking **Activate**.

2\. Once the plugin is activated you'll see the WooCommerce setup screen. 


#### Onboarding Wizard

An on-boarding wizard will guide you through the installation steps to configure WooCommerce.

1\. **Store Setup**: Enter your store's location, currency accepted and the types of products you plan to sell.

[![Store Setup](/images/storesetup.png)](/images/storesetup.png)

2\. **Payment**: Setup the payment methods used by your shop.

There are two online payment options available, Stripe and PayPal. You must register with your chosen payment method before you can accept payments using their services. To simplify the configuration here, you won't configure the online payment options. Deselect Stripe and PayPal options.

Expand the **Offline Payments** section. Select the **Cash on Delivery** option. Click **Continue.**

[![Payment Options](/images/paymentoptions.png)](/images/paymentoptions.png)

3\. **Shipping**: Set your shipping options. You can include weight and dimension units used to ship your products.

For this demo, we're going to use *Flat Rate* as our shipping method at $5. Turn off the option of *Location not covered by your other zones*. Leave the **Weight unit** and **Dimension unit** configuration as default. Click **Continue** to proceed.

[![Shipping](/images/shipping.png)](/images/shipping.png)

4\. **Recommended**: Shows you the recommended features to be installed for your WooCommerce store. For this demo, we'll select only the **Storefront Theme** option. Click **Continue** to proceed.

[![Shipping](/images/shipping.png)](/images/shipping.png)

5\. Your store is now setup and ready to add your first product! Click **Create a product** button to add a product to your store.

[![Wizard Complete](/images/wizardcomplete.png)](/images/wizardcomplete.png)


### Adding a new product

#### Shop Organization: Categories, product tags, and attributes

Recall that your imaginary client YayWP! is selling large posters. Presumably, YayWP! customers are interested in the thematics and the size of the picture. You will use Product Categories to indicate the thematic. You will also have to manage the sizes available for sale.

**Product categories and tags** are similar to regular post categories and tags. Use product categories for grouping and product tags for details. There are two reasons why you should organize your products by category:

*   The larger the print, the more expensive. So you'll want to be able to set different prices for different sizes. You should use a category for you product and tags to list the different sizes and pricing. This means your picture and all its sizes will be listed as one item. This will make it easier for your customers to find and order the product.
*   A user might want to include both size and thematics as their search parameters simultaneously.

**Variable products** are a product type in WooCommerce. They let you offer a set of variations on a product. You can control prices, stock, image, and more for each variation.

**Attributes** are pieces of data. Use them to add more technical information to a product. This helps users to refine your catalog while browsing/searching. Additionally, attributes are a key component of authoring variable products. 

[![Attributes](/images/attributes.png)](/images/attributes.png)

Go to **WooCommerce > Products > Attributes** section. Add an attribute before you create different variations of the picture. Type in “size” for the attribute name, and click **Add Attribute**.

#### Managing a new variable product

1\. Go to: **Products > Add New**. Adding a product feels like writing a regular post in WordPress, so the view of the form should be familiar.

[![Add new product](/images/addnewproduct.png)](/images/addnewproduct.png)
Fill in the basic data first: name of the product, description, and  product categories as shown in the image above.

2\. Add a product image using the Product Image form (under product tags). You may use a sample picture provided to “sell” it or use some other picture of your liking. This is how an added image appears once you add it: 

[![Add product image](/images/addproductimage.png)](/images/addproductimage.png) 

3\. Now, make the product variable. Select **Variable product** option in the Product Data dropdown list.

>![(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/contributor-resources/master/images/icon-idea.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/contributor-resources/master/images/icon-idea.png)Here is a bit more detail about some of the other product options:
>*   A **Simple** product type describes the physical off-line product which requires shipping. A book or a laptop, which do not require variation, are simple products.
>*   A **Virtual** product is a product that doesn’t require shipping. For example, online tarot reading.
>*   A **Downloadable** product is similar to a virtual product. In this instance, the customer is given a file to download. This could be an indie video game.

At the moment, virtual and downloadable products are not present in our list. These aren't included because we have no digital payment method configured.

4\. Click through the first tabs of Product data meta box: **Inventory**, **Shipping**, and **Linked products**. This is where you can add some important data for your products. At the moment, you will skip through them and go straight to setting the product attributes and variations. Open the **Attributes** section. 

[![Set attributes](/images/setattributes.png)](/images/setattributes.png)

5\. Select "size" from the select box, and click **Add**.
>![(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/contributor-resources/master/images/icon-idea.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wptrainingteam/contributor-resources/master/images/icon-idea.png)By choosing ‘Custom product attribute’ from the select box, you can apply a custom product-level. This will not be available in layered navigation or other products. 

6\. Once you have chosen an attribute and added it, apply the terms attached to that attribute to the product. You can hide the attribute on the frontend of your site by leaving the **Visible on the product page** checkbox unchecked. 

Check both of the checkboxes and click **Add new** to add the values to the poster's available sizes. 

7\. Type in 27x39" and click **OK**. Repeat adding with 18x11" size. 

[![Size attributes](/images/sizeattribute.png)](/images/sizeattribute.png)

8\. Save the entered attributes data by clicking **Save attributes**.

9\. Switch to the **Variations** tab. Make sure **Create variations from all attributes** option is selected and click **Go**. Then click **OK** on the confirmation message pop-up.

10\. You now have two variations for your product. Next, you'll set up how they should be distinguished on your product page. 

[![Variations](/images/variations.png)](/images/variations.png)

Click each of the variation panels. For each combination enter price - $15 for the larger poster and $10 for the smaller one. 

[![Variation prices](/images/variationprices.png)](/images/variationprices.pn)
 
11\. Click **Save changes** when you are finished.

12\. Try to save the product now. Click **Publish** to publish the product. 

### Shop Overview

You now have an operational shop. Take a look by going to the **Shop** page of your site. 

[![Shop overview](/images/shopoverview.png)](/images/shopoverview.png) 

The look is not polished, but the foundation for a great WordPress-based shop is there for you to refine. For example, you can improve your shop by creating custom menus. Once created, you can place them in your theme’s menu areas or in a widgetized area (use the menus widget). 

### WooCommerce menu items

#### Dashboard

The WordPress customizable dashboard is the first thing you should see when you log in to the site. After activation, WooCommerce adds two dashboard widgets to help you monitor your store:

*   The **WooCommerce recent reviews** widget displays your store’s most recent reviews.
*   The **WooCommerce Status** widget gives you a quick overview of your store. It alerts you if you have an order processing, an order on-hold, or a product is running low on stock. It also displays sales statistics.


[![Dashboard](/images/dashboard.png)](/images/dashboard.png)


#### WooCommerce Menu

Take a look at the other menu sections. 

1\. Use the **Orders** section to view and manage orders. This will display all orders placed by customers at your shop.

[![Orders](/images/orders.png)](/images/orders.png)

2\. The **Coupons** section allows you to create discount coupons. Customers can apply them on the checkout page. 

[![Coupons](/images/coupons.png)](/images/coupons.png)

3\. In the **Reports** section, you can view data on the store activity and export it as a .csv file. 

[![Reports](/images/reports.png)](/images/reports.png)

4\. The **Settings** section contains all the settings you need when setting up your shop. You have already explored general store settings, products settings, shipping, payments and more.

[![Settings](/images/settings.png)](/images/settings.png)

5\. **Status** provides a snapshot of your setup. It will highlight potential conflicts. Use this for troubleshooting on your own or when contacting support. 

[![Status](/images/status.png)](/images/status.png)

6\. The **Extensions** section is where you can find more plugins and extensions. These will help you to extend the functionality and features of your store.

[![Extensions](/images/extensions.png)](/images/extensions.png)

#### Products Menu

 This top-level menu has sections relating to managing products. This lesson used the **Products** and **Attributes** sections earlier. There are additional sections to modify, add, and delete product **Categories** and **Tags.**
